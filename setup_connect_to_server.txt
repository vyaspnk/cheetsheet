There are bookmarks, you must know...
Open a new TextEdit document, change to unformatted text mode via the Format menu, and enter a connection string with the same scheme shown in the Scripter's Way (but without the scripting code, of course): 

protocol://username:password@server/share 

Ex: smb://root:avi123@10.10.26.123/vyas-bar-1

Now select this line and drag-and-drop it onto your Desktop. You should get a new file with a bookmark icon. If it's just a text clipping icon, the syntax of your connection string was incorrect.
